Task 1
Using one of the following languages - Java, Python, Javascript – and using Selenium, write the following program:
Receive an input: a CSV of two columns, one is “City” (containing names of cities around the world) and the other is “zoom_num”, which is a non-negative integer N (bigger or equal than zero) (see attached file for example).
On each row, preform the following steps:
1.	Open Google Maps
2.	Search for the city in the column.
3.	Take a screenshot
4.	Print the current URL for the page in the output logs
5.	Press “zoom in” the number of times as the Integer (N times) in the same row’s “zoom_num” cell.
6.	Take another screenshot
7.	Print the current URL for the page in the output logs
8.	Then, press “zoom out” half the number of times as the above integer (N/2 times), and save it 
9.	Print the current URL for the page in the output logs
Please send your project as a zip file or send a link to a shared folder. 
Task 2
You work in a company that provides managed security camera services. Companies connect their CCTV cameras to your infrastructure, and you are in charge of both the video streaming abilities of their cameras and their recordings. A few guidelines for this product:
1.	Companies can only view their own cameras.
2.	No more then 5 different devices can view one camera at a time.
3.	A company can choose the “chunk-size” of a video recorded (1 hour, 4 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours).
4.	The number of recorded videos in the system is variable: a company can pay to save videos from a week, a month and a year back.
5.	Some cameras can be turned on and off from through a user interface.
6.	The user Interface is available on a mobile app or through a web browser.
Given this info, write a list of high-level test cases for the different features of the system. You may assume different architectural aspects of the system, as long as you clarify what you assumed.

Good luck!
